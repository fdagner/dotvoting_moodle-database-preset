#  Dot Voting

dot voting is a preset for the Moodle activity database.

## Description

Users can create a dot voting.

## Getting started

Download the [release file](https://github.com/fdagner/mindmap_moodle-database-preset-/releases). 
Create a "Database" activity in Moodle and then upload the ZIP file.

To define and change the categories, go to "Fields" and enter them in the “choice” dropdown menu. You can specify the number of dots in the “number” field.
